<p align="center">Graphle is a service build to make learning easy for autistic students. It takes in real time input from the teacher, and arranges it in a visual manner</p>

<p align="center">Autistic kids often receive education in a special way where concepts are delivered in a graphical way. Research says that visual memory is 60,000X faster than text/auditory memory. Inspired by graphical learning we created Graphle, a very effective visual learning tool for strengthening visual memory of our students.

With use of cutting-edge technology, Graphle can be of greate use in remote education, where teachers can take their classroom boards to their students and allow Graphle simplify concepts for them.

<h2 align="center">What have we build?</h2>
<br>

 - An android app which captures speech of the teacher/instructor and converts it to text and sends it to our backend
  - The text is processed and converted into images using Neural Networks(Generative adversarial network)
  - The generated images are shown to the smart screen in the classroom or to the induvidual screen of the student(Remote Classroom).(Sessions can be viewed on our website)
